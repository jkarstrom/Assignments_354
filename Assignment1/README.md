# What we learned
# How to code a calculator
# How to use functions in Haskell
# How to use hypothetical trees and recursion to create order of operations simulation
# Haskell has specific substitutions for division, mod, etc in its implementation using the ` character
# SO MUCH can be defined using just a base of integers.


# What is completed and where we had problems
# We have completed all parts of the assignment
# We ran into problems with parenthesis in the arithmetic specification


# Known Problems
# -n / m returns -n for abs(-n) < m but all other scenarios work as far as we could decipher EX -1 / 3 = -1 where 1 / 3 = 0


# Testing
# Arithmetic was tested in the arithmetic, whereas we tested cases in the command prompt for Calculator Part 2


# Assignment and Theory
# The assignment is a clear representation of what we worked in class. From building order of operation trees to simply applying definitions of natural numbers, then using said natural numbers to define other data types and make abstract mathematical understanding into something a machine can decipher using a base of integers.
